/*
 * Description: Optimizes the function `eval` by exploring the neighbor solutions using simulated annealing.
 * - `time_limit`: The maximum time to run the algorithm.
 * - `t_0`: Initial temperature.
 * - `t_f`: Final temperature.
 * - `a`: Cooling rate.
 * The algorithm works for both minimization, to maximize you should change `(old_val - new_val)` to `(new_val - old_val)` and (eval_nxt < best) to (eval_nxt > best)
 * `P(old_val, new_val, temp)` computes the probability of accepting a worse solution based on the current temperature.
 * Usage:
 * - `ans` is the data type of the answer.
 * - `repr` is the data structure of the representation of the solution.
 * - `neighbor`: given `repr`, you can get a random neighbor solution.
 * - `eval`: allows to get the evaluation of the representation.
 *
 * Tips:
 * - Always write your intermediate solution to a file periodically (e.g., every ~1 million iterations) to ensure partial scores if the process is interrupted.
 * - To choose a good $t_0$ and $alpha$, start with a high $t_0$ and a low $alpha$, then adjust based on how the temperature and energy function behave. Use binary search on $alpha$ to find an optimal cooling rate.
 * - Running the simulated annealing for a longer time with a larger $alpha$ is generally better than restarting with a previous solution and a lower $t_0$.
 * 
 * Status: Tested in DIY Tree (Codeforces).
